# angular-starter-yitimo
Mainly refer to AngularClass/angular-starter, but remove the hmr part and test part.
For study purpose I added my own comment through the whole starter, but the version may not always be the latest.
To get the best powerful starter you can go to [angular-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular-starter "AngularClass/angular-starter"), and it will have a lot more to study.
