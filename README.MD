# angular-starter-yitimo
Mainly refer to AngularClass/angular-starter, but remove the hmr part and test part.
For study purpose I added my own comment through the whole starter, but the version may not always be the latest.
To get the best powerful starter you can go to [angular-starter](https://github.com/gdi2290/angular-starter "angular-starter"), and it will have a lot more to study.

## How to run
```
    git clone
    cd angular-starter-yitimo
    yarn
    npm run server
```
* you may need to have python installed for the node-sass package

* if you still want to use npm to install the libs, just remove the ``"preinstall"`` script inside ``package.json``

## How to build (prod mode)
```
npm run build:aot:prod
```
* for more options for building or running the project, see the scripts inside ``package.json > scripts``
